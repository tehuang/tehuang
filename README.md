### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Yu-Hsuan (Teresa) 
#### I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science at Stevens Institute of Technology
Before enrolloing Stevens as a graduate student, I spent over 4 years working as an IT support analyst at Qualcomm. About a year ago, I realized my desire to learn more and immerse myself in the field of information technology. This realization led me to study abroad to gain further knowledge and experience.

**Skills**: Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, APIs, MongoDB, Mongoose, React.js

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on seeking job opportunities within the fields of cybersecurity, software, and information technology. 
- ðŸŒ± Currently, I have completed the learning in [Web Development](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/)
