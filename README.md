### Hi there 👋, I'm Yu-Hsuan (Teresa) 
#### I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science at Stevens Institute of Technology
Before enrolloing Stevens as a graduate student, I spent over 4 years working as an IT support analyst at Qualcomm. About a year ago, I realized my desire to learn more and immerse myself in the field of information technology. 

**Skills**: Java, Python, SQL, Linux, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, React.js, APIs, MongoDB, GitHub, and PowerShell

- 🔭 I’m currently working on seeking job opportunities within the fields of cybersecurity, software, and information technology. 
- 🌱 I have completed the learning in [Web Development](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) and have built up my own [portfolio](https://tehuang.github.io/Portfolio/). I am also actively learning [React](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-tutorial-and-projects-course/) from Udemy.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I love penguins and outdoor activities! I've tried flying a small airplane once and hold a certificate for piloting a yacht. Additionally, I also have experience in scuba diving and surfing.
